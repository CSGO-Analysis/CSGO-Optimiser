Nvidia CSGO Profile:
Imports an NVIDIA 3D profile that changes the settings for csgo.exe only.
Optimised for high performance in CSGO.



Autoexec.cfg:
Adds an autoexec.cfg with the following commands:
rate "128000"
fps_max "999"
cl_interp "0"
cl_interp_ratio "1"
cl_updaterate "128"
cl_cmdrate "128"
cl_forcepreload "1"
mat_queue_mode "2"

These are optimal settings. Might not be perfect if you have a very slow internet connection.
**THIS WILL OVERWRITE ANY PRE-EXISTING AUTOEXEC.CFG FILES**



Ingame Video Settings:
Turns off most of the 'Advanced video settings' in the game options for high performance (Will give best results with NVIDIA CSGO Profile activated)



Launch Options:
Adds the following launch options:
-console (Activates console ingame)
-freq XXX (The optimiser will automatically detect your monitors hertz limits and set it accordingly)
-novid (Removes the short video on CSGO startup)
+exec autoexec.cfg (executes the configuration file with optimised rates)
-high (Sets the csgo.exe process to 'high' priority for a small fps boost)



Mouse Acceleration:
The optimiser will automatically detect your setup and install the correct changes to windows registry for a 1-to-1, no acceleration mouse input. (Will give the best results with the 'Ingame acceleration commands' installed aswell.)
(Thanks to MarkC for his acceleration fixes)



Ingame acceleration commands:
Adds an IngameMouseAccelOff.cfg with the following commands:
m_forward "1"
m_mousespeed "1"
m_mouseaccel2 "0"
m_mouseaccel1 "0"
m_customaccel "0"
m_customaccel_max "0"
m_customaccel_exponent "0"
m_customaccel_scale "0"
m_rawinput "0"



Disable Caps Lock for use with VoIP:
Disables the normal Caps Lock function (Key is remapped to F13) so you can use Caps Lock for Push-to-talk without talking in CAPS half the time.



Deactivate visual themes on csgo.exe:
Deactivates some Windows visual graphics/animation on csgo.exe for a small fps boost.
